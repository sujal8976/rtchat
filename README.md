# RtChat v2

RtChat v2 is a purely room-based real-time chat system. It allows users to create and join chat rooms. The system is designed to be fast and performant.

## Features
- **Room-based real-time communication**: Users can join any room and chat in real time.
- **Accessible**: Anyone can join.
- **Fast and performant**: Built with optimized tech stacks for speed and reliability.

---

## Tech Stack
- **Monorepo**: Managed with Turborepo for efficient development.
- **Frontend & HTTP Server**: Built with Next.js.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for rapid UI development.
- **WebSocket Server**: Implemented using the `ws` library in Node.js.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for robust and reliable data storage.
- **ORM**: Prisma for database schema management and query building.
- **State Management**: Zustand for simple and flexible client-side state handling.

## System Design
The development of RtChat v2 adheres to several fundamental and efficient system design principles to ensure reliability, performance, and maintainability:

- **Debouncing**: Implemented to prevent redundant API calls during rapid user actions, enhancing responsiveness and reducing server load.
- **Infinite Scrolling**: Used in chat history views to load data progressively as the user scrolls, ensuring a smooth user experience.
- **Singleton Pattern**: Applied to manage WebSocket connections both on the frontend and backend, ensuring a single active connection per client and reducing resource usage.
- **Database Indexing**: Added indexes to frequently queried fields to optimize database performance and reduce query latency.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clearly divided responsibilities among different components and services for better maintainability.
- **Retry and Fallback Mechanisms**: Incorporated retries for transient failures in WebSocket communication, with appropriate fallback strategies.
- **Efficient State Management**: Utilized lightweight state management library `zustand` to manage application state seamlessly without unnecessary overhead.

```

### Step 3: Configure environment variables
Add environment variables for each app. Refer to the `.env.example` file in the respective directories for guidance.

#### apps/web/.env
```env
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=test
AUTH_TRUST_HOST=http://localhost:3000
WS_URL=ws://localhost:5000
JWT_SECRET=your-256-bit-secret
NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL=ws://localhost:5000
```

#### apps/ws/.env
```env
JWT_SECRET=your-256-bit-secret
PORT=5000
```

#### packages/db/.env
```env
DATABASE_URL="postgres://postgres:@localhost:5432/rtchat"
```

### Step 4: Run Prisma migrations
Apply the database migrations:
```bash
pnpm run prisma:migrate
```

### Step 5: Generate Prisma client
Generate the Prisma client for database interactions:
```bash
pnpm run prisma:generate
```

### Step 6: Seed the database
Populate the database with initial data:
```bash
pnpm run prisma:seed
```

### Step 7: Start the development server
Start both the frontend and WebSocket servers:
```bash
pnpm run dev
```

## Known Issues

### Issue: Refresh required after login
After logging in, users may need to refresh the page to see updated session data. This occurs due to a known issue in `next-auth` v5 (beta), where server-side updates happen immediately but client-side updates lag.

#### Why does this happen?
When a user logs in, the session is updated server-side, but the client-side session state isn't immediately refreshed. This issue is tracked in the following GitHub discussion:
[NextAuth.js Issue #11034](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth/issues/11034)

#### Current Workaround
We are actively exploring solutions, including switching away from `next-auth` or implementing custom authentication logic.
